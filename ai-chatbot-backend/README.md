# AI Chatbot Backend

This is the backend for the AI Chatbot web app. It acts as a proxy to the OpenAI API.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in this directory with your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will run on port 5000 by default.
